# ASPxGridView - How to highlight a row when a user checks a templated ASPxCheckBox


<p>The example's page contains ASPxGridView with ASPxCheckBox placed into a column's DataItemTemplate. It addition, there is ASPxCallback on the page. If a row ASPxCheckBox is checked, a callback to the server is sent via ASPxCallback to update a database. At the same time, a parent row's background color is changed on the client side without refreshing ASPxGridView.</p><p>Please note that row highlighting is based on the jQuery library.</p>
